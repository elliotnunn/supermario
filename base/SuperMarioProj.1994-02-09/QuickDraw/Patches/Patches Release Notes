Radar bug: #1031825

> Release notes for this change:

Sped up drawing to 16 and 32 bit screens by putting these through the appropriate
ScaleBlt cases (a 16 bit ScaleBlt loop was added for this purpose). Also added a special
case loop for 1->16 and 1->32 (from Sean Callahan)  in ScaleBlt as well as a general
indexed->indexed loop. Changed the meaning of multColor to be a bitfield where bit 0
means the source is black and white only. This allows us to take fast colorizing cases
for text. MakeScaleTbl was changed so that when colorizing it checks if it needs to to
invert the background color and does so appropriately. Changed the Font manager so that
it no longer marks synthetic fonts created with an arithmetic transfer mode as color
fonts.

> What was tested:

Checked colorized text drawing to all bit depths for II and IIci ROMs.
Checked srcCopy and notSrcCopy CopyBits cases for indexed->indexed and indexed->direct
for II and IIci ROMs (along with clipping and alignment cases).
Tested inversion of background colour to 1 bit destinations when fg and bg colours are
different but map to the same index.

Radar bug: 

> Release notes for this change:

Fixed a bug where we were crashing when Macromind Director or Aldus Freehand were putting
up their splash screen on a Mac II with an 8 bit screen. Fixed a problem where StkLowPt
and HiHeapMark were getting munged by Stretch in low memory situations. Fixed notSrcCopy
and Search Proc problems

> What was tested:

Tested Aldus Freehand and Macromind Director on both Mac II and IIci. Tested notSrcCopy
on both machines. Tested search procs on both machines.

Radar bug: #1033729

> Release notes for this change:

Fixed a bug where we were not properly recognizing all cases where we were drawing to the
alpha channel in CopyBits. This was causing zero to be written to the alpha channel
instead of the apropriate alpha information. We now look at the actual stream mode in the
color port along with the foreground and background longs in stretch’s stack frame. If
they indicate that data is being drawn to the alpha channel we go slow, otherwise we take
the faster loops in ScaleBlt.

> What was tested:

Tested alpha channel drawing for CopyBits and all objects on Mac II and IIci ROMs using
arith to 16 and 32 bit destinations. Tested normal CopyBits cases to make sure they
weren’t affected.

Radar bug: #1039892

> Release notes for this change:

Fixed a bug where the 1 bit to 16 bit non-colorizing ScaleBlt loop would trash the bit
offset into the source if the offset was greater than 64. This caused source bits to the
left of the desired area to be read.

> What was tested:

Tested on both a IIx and Quadra 700 using Hypercard and a 16 bit monitor. Saw no visual
problems. Verified in Macsbug that we hit the case of interest and that the code took the
correct action.

Radar bug: #1040323

> Release notes for this change:

Fixed a bug in MakeScaleTbl that was breaking SeedCFill for indexed pixmaps. When drawing
to a one bit destination, MakeScaleTbl was checking if the foreground and background
colors mapped to the same index. If so, the background color was inverted before
colorizing. SeedCFill installs a one bit search proc that makes all non-seed colors map
to the same index. This was causing us to invert the background color when we didn’t want
to. Consequently the resulting scale table mapped all indexes to non-seed colors and so
the SeedCFill did not work.

To minimize risk, the fix is to check if the foreground is black and the background is
white before inverting the background color. This is always true when coming from
SeedCFill. This reduces the affected cases to SeedCFill or a CopyBits from an indexed
source to a one bit destination with black foreground and white background which map to
the same index (because of a search proc).

> What was tested:

Tested SeedCFIll on Mac II and IIci roms. Also tested with Color MacCheese (flood fill),
SearchGack, DTS’s sample apps SeedCFill 32bit and SeedCFIll 8bit (which found the bug)
and Tomato.
