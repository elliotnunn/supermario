;	Language:	"C"

;	Revision:	1.0
;	Author:		Charlton E. Lui
;	
; 	Patch collator is a simple program that scans through files looking for Apple System Patches.
;	It finds a patch comment by finding a header that looks like this...
;	
;	*** One to one mapping of a fix ***
;					Fix File	Date		Patch#	Fix Routine(s)		Routine(s) Fixed
;*AppleSystemPatch 	DrawPicturePatch.a	08Jul85		#0		(InstallRDrivers) 	(InstallRDrivers)		
;
;	*** One to many mapping of a fix ***
;					Fix File	Date		Patch#	Fix Routine(s)		Routine(s) Fixed
;*AppleSystemPatch 	DrawPicturePatch.a	09Dec85		#13 	(SoundVBLAddress) 	(RecoverHandle,ROMBMap)
;
; 	*** Many to one mapping of a fix ***
;					Fix File	Date		Patch#	Fix Routine(s)		Routine(s) Fixed
;*AppleSystemPatch 	DrawPicturePatch.a	17May86		#47 	(FontMgr,DialogMgr) (GetRsrc)
;
;	*** One to many mapping of a fix ***
;					Fix File	Date		Patch#	Fix Routine(s)		Routine(s) Fixed
;*AppleSystemPatch 	DrawPicturePatch.a	23Apr86		#43 	(BTFlush,BTClose) 	(BTFlush,BTClose)
;
;
;
;	The examples show the many mappings a fix may have.  Each file should have the appropiate ROM
;	version already inserted atop the file so it does not need be entered.
;
;	WARNING: To make sure the scan works properly, use parenthesis around the routine field(s).
;
;	This header will be inserted atop of each patch file. Whenever a new patch is entered the person
;	who is entering the patch will copy the header down to the place where they are making the fix 
;	and enter the pertinent information.  
;
;	IMPORTANT! Make sure to take out the asterix before the AppleSystemPatch symbol.  
;	The "*" was added so that Patch Collator would not mistake the comments above as 
;	an actual patch.  So delete the "*" before.  Also, make sure that there is no
;	space between the ";"(semicolon) and the "AppleSystemPatch" symbol.  It should look like this
;	";AppleSystemPatch".
;
;	A file will contain a list of names of the main patch files.  Patch collator will use 
;	MPW's funnel facility to feed the names into the patch collator. 
;
;	PatchCollator < PatchFiles
;
;	The files will also be scanned for other patch file includes.  The included patch files will 
;	be added to the list of patch files. 
;
;	Each file will be scanned for patch information and then entered into a binary tree.
;	The binary tree is used to sort the patch list alpabetically. After it finishes, 
;	it disposes of all of the nodes of the tree.
;
;	Patch Collator uses simple parsing techniques. It does not check whether or not the information
;	is correct or not.  Patch Collator will leave that for the AI group.
;
;	Output will contain the information something like this...

; This patch to PackBits allows scanlines passed to packBits to be

; except the Mac II.
;
; Note that this patch does not pack images exactly the same as a Mac II.
; (To do so would have taken more code.)
