Radar bug: #1024868

> Release notes for this change:

The Assert routine no longer calls MacsBug, so the assertion strings are all sitting around wasting
memory.  Since Assert now just returns whatever Boolean was passed in, don’t call it at all.


> What was tested:

There is no difference in system behaviour before and after this change while using double byte
TrueType fonts, which is what this code affects.

Radar bug: #1023997

> Release notes for this change:

InitializePartialFonts and InitializeDiskCache should be pascal function.

> What was tested:

Kanji TrueType works fine with a new ‘Two-Byte Script Extension’.

Radar bug: #1025684

> Release notes for this change:

Instead of hard-coding, calculate the number of master pointers initially created in the partial font zone at runtime

> What was tested:

Modified the heap zone size given in the ‘Two-Byte Script Extension’, then the expected result were observed.

Radar bug: #1025909

> Release notes for this change:

Remove calls to VerifyPartialFontStructures and the routine itself.  This routine just returns once 
it has been called, so it’s just wasting memory being there.  Don’t call it since it doesn’t do
anything, and conditionalize out the routine to save some bytes.


> What was tested:

Booted system, and looked at routines which used to call it, and made sure there are no references
to this routine.  Also looked for this routine’s name in the linked patch block, and it’s no longer
there, which means it is not being compiled.

Radar bug: #1034875

> Release notes for this change:

The partial TrueType code in Cube-E assumes that the partial font zone is always present.
This is not the case in the base system.  If this code ever executes, it will dereference
nil, and if EvenBetterBusError is installed, crash.  Normally this code doesn’t execute,
since Roman ‘sfnt’ resources will be able to load into memory successfully, and the
partial font code is not executed.  However, in low memory situations, if the ‘sfnt’
fails to load, the partial font code will kick in and do strange things because there is
no partial font zone.  To get around this, create a small, 5K partial font zone for the
base system for these low memory situations.  This also provides a degredation case.

> What was tested:

Excel would crash with a bus error in the partial font code if the partial font zone does
not exist.  With this change, Excel does not crash.  Since WorldScript II creates a
partial font zone as well, I added a check to see if a partial font zone already exists.
If it does, and the existing zone is smaller than the requested zone size, the existing
zone is destroyed and a new one created.  I verified that the base system’s 5K zone is
replaced by WorldScript II’s 150K zone when that script extension is installed.
