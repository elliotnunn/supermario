Radar bug: #1031085

> Release notes for this change:

The change made to the pop up CDEF to fix the duplicate pop up menu problem in control
panels broke the Comm Toolbox tools that have pop up menus.  This happened because the
Comm Toolbox assumed that the pop up menus were always in the menu list, which is no
longer true.

The Comm Toolbox was changed to no longer look in the menu list for the pop up menu.
Instead, it looks inside the pop up menu data structure for the handle to the menu, which
is the documented way of getting the menu handle anyway.

> What was tested:

Both MacTerminal and LoCalChooser (a simple Comm Toolbox tool chooser) would fail when a
tool is picked, because the tool would call back to the Comm Toolbox for initialization.
Comm Toolbox would then try to get the menu handle, fail, and pass that error all the way
back.  With this change, the tools all work properly, and you get some pretty massive
dialogs with lots and lots of pop up menus.

Radar bug: 

> Release notes for this change:

I stripped all of the “TheFuture” conditionals from all of the ComToolbox files per Mike
Bells instructions. I also had to delete some code that was conditionalized for “CubeE”
so that it would work.

> What was tested:

 It would be nice if testing could bless this. I ran MacTerminal and it seems to work,
but this is by no means adequate. I spoke with Alex Rosen, and he said that what I was
doing should be ok, but that there was no test suite for the CommToolbox.
