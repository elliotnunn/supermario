Radar bug: #1022940

> Release notes for this change:

Fixed Standard file to recognize invisible volumes. Special cased ISO and High Sierra version 2.03 cd rom case. (They are accidentally marked invisible) 

Also fixed the “hook” mechanism to recognize filtering done to surpress warning dialogs and such.



> What was tested:

Made one of my drives “invisible” and it doesn’t show up in the standard file dialog.
Tested the filter changes in MacsBug by emulating a filter proc that changes item hit to surpress a dialog.
Still need to test the High Sierra case. I will do that in the morning when I can borrow a CD rom drive.

Radar bug: #1019375

> Release notes for this change:

Standard File locks the keyboard on entry and unlocks it on exit.  It should avoid this if the keyboard
was locked coming in.

> What was tested:

Locked the keyboard and watched StandardFile skip it’s call to KeyScript(smDisableKeybd) on entry,
and watched it skip the call to KeyScript(smEnableKeybd) on exit.

Radar bug: #1028452

> Release notes for this change:

For a6, special checks were added in Standard File to ignore invisible volumes, mainly
for 20/20.  However, these checks were made before it was determined that a volume was
online.  This meant that it would always ask for a disk, if it was offline.  Therefore,
the machine would ask for a disk back immediately after it was ejected with the Eject
button.  The check to see if a volume is invisible or not was moved to after the check to
see if the volume was on line, so that the machine would not ask for the disk back.


> What was tested:

Before, if the user hits the eject button to eject a floppy, the machine would ask for it
back immediately.  WIth this change, the machine does not ask for the disk back when
Eject is clicked.

Radar bug: #1034877

> Release notes for this change:

Modify Standard File to take better care of it’s pop-up menu.  The old pop-up CDEF used
to take care of deleting and disposing the menu when the control was destroyed.  This
behavior changed for Cube-E to support multiple control panels having the same menu ID in
them.  So, we have to change Standard File to delete and dispose of the pop-up menu
handle when exiting.  Leaving the menu in the list can have some bizarre consequences in
the MPW Shell, since the shell will “clean up” after tools that allocate memory and don’t
dispose of it.  The shell mistakes the left over menu handle for a tool allocation and
disposes of the memory block without deleting the menu from the menu list.  Pandemonium
soon follows.

> What was tested:

Run the reproducible Shell crash/confusion with and without the fix.  Examine the menu
list in several apps that use standard file and verify that no menus are being left over
in memory.

Radar bug: #1034877

> Release notes for this change:

There was a problem with the previous change: the path popup in the directory dialog
would get initialized correctly, but it wouldn’t update its contents as you navigated
around the catalog hierarchy. The popup would stay the same as it started, not matter
which folders you were in.

The problem was caused by the fact that the code to delete and dispose the menu was
removed because we thought the popup CDEF was doing this. We were only partially correct.
Here’s what happens now:

--The popup control is initialized; the popup CDEF inserts the menu into the menu list
and removes it before returning from the initialize call. As long as the menu isn’t in
the menu list when the CDEF is called, the CDEF inserts and removes the menu at the
beginning and end of each call.
--Standard File builds its initial menu and inserts it into the menu list and also puts
it into the CDEF’s private data structure like it supposed to. It also tries to remove
the CDEF’s menu from the menu list, but since it’s not there, the _DeleteMenu call
doesn’t do anything.
--On subsequent calls to the CDEF, since the menu is already in the menu list, the CDEF
doesn’t do anything with the menu, leaving it in the list.
--Each time the directory changes, the menu rebuild code in SF removes the obsolete menu
and inserts the updated one. (The code to remove the obsolete menu was the part that was
incorrectly deleted in the previous change. This caused the insert of the updated menu to
fail.)
--When SF is done, it deletes and disposes the menu. The CDEF won’t do this because it
assumes SF owns the menu since SF was the one to place it in the menu list.

> What was tested:

Tried Standard File and verified that the path popup updated correctly while navigating
into and out of different folders. Also verified that the menu handle was correctly
removed from the menu list and disposed at the end of the Standard File call.
