	The comma-separated field specifications (following -f) take the forms:

		or	[F][.C][+N][bdlqrtux]

	'F' is a field number (0=whole line [default], 1=first word, 2=second word…).
	'C' is the starting column number (from 1), default=1.
	'K' is the ending column number >= C, default=infinite.
	'N' is the maximum number of characters in the field, default=infinite.
	Only one of '-K' or '+N' can be specified.
	
	The local modifier characters 'bdlqrtux' have the same meaning on a
	per-field basis as -b, -d, -l, -q, -r, -t, -u and -x (which take effect

		address1 || address2	# match line matching address1 OR address2

		/regular expression/	# a line that matches the expression
		•						# matches BEFORE the first line
		N						# matches the Nth line
		$						# matches the last line
		∞						# matches AFTER the last line

	A regular expression starting with 'ç' is case-sensitive.  Any '•' must
	follow the 'ç'.

	Commands are:
	
		Append <text>			# append text to append buffer
		Exit [status]			# exit with zero or specified status
		Change <text>			# set contents of edit buffer
		Delete					# clear contents of edit buffer

		Set variable <text> 	# set variable's value
			[-a]				#	 append to variable's current value
			[-i]				#	 insert at front of variable's current value
		Option AutoDelete		# append "1,$ Delete" to script
	
	Where <text> consists of zero or more of:
	
		"a string"				# the specified text
		'a string'				# the specified text
		.						# the current line (the edit buffer)
		variableName			# the contents of the named string variable
		®N						# an "®" variable set by a regular expression
		-from <filename>		# the next line from the file, where filename
								#	 is a string or a variable name
		-n						# suppress newline at end
