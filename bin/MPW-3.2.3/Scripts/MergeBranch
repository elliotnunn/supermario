#
#	MergeBranch - Merge a branch revision onto the trunk.
#
#	Usage:	MergeBranch file
#
#	MergeBranch renames the branch revision "file" to "file",branch and
#	checks out the latest revision on the revision trunk for modification.
#
#		If there are no trunk revisions newer than the branch, then the branch
#		is checked in as the latest trunk revision.
#
#		Otherwise MergeBranch brings up both revisions on the screen and
#		puts them side by side.  A menu is appended to the menu bar to assist
#		the user in the merge process.  Checkin the new trunk revision "file"
#		when you finish merging the changes in "file",branch into "file".
#
#	To add MergeBranch to a menu, execute the following command:
#
#		AddMenu Project 'MergeBranch' 'MergeBranch "{Active}" ∑∑ "{WorkSheet}"'
#
#	This script creates three temporary files which are deleted on exit or abort.
#	{ShellDirectory}Compare_File, {ShellDirectory}Compare_State and file,<rev>,
#
#	MergeBranch calls the script CompareFiles.
