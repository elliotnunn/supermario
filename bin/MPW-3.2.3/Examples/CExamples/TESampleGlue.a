;	TESample is an example application that demonstrates how 
;	to initialize the commonly used toolbox managers, operate 
;	successfully under MultiFinder, handle desk accessories and 
;	create, grow, and zoom windows. The fundamental TextEdit 
;	toolbox calls and TextEdit autoscroll are demonstrated. It 
;	also shows how to create and maintain scrollbar controls.
;
;	It does not by any means demonstrate all the techniques you 
;	need for a large application. In particular, Sample does not 
;	cover exception handling, multiple windows/documents, 
;	sophisticated memory management, printing, or undo. All of 
;	these are vital parts of a normal full-sized application.
;
;	This application is an example of the form of a Macintosh 
;	application; it is NOT a template. It is NOT intended to be 
;	used as a foundation for the next world-class, best-selling, 
;	600K application. A stick figure drawing of the human body may 
;	be a good example of the form for a painting, but that does not 
;	mean it should be used as the basis for the next Mona Lisa.
;
;	We recommend that you review this program or Sample before 
;	beginning a new application. Sample is a simple app. which doesn’t 
;	use TextEdit or the Control Manager.
;

;
;	AsmClikLoop
;
;	This routine gets called by the TextEdit Manager from TEClick.
;	It calls the old, default click loop routine that scrolls the
;	text, and then calls our own Pascal routine that handles
;	tracking the scroll bars to follow along.  It doesn't bother
;	with saving registers A0 and D0, because they are trashed
;	anyway by TextEdit.
